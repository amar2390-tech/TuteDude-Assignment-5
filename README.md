# Assignment 5 – Data Structures and Strings in Python

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates the use of basic Python data structures such as
dictionaries and lists. It consists of two tasks that focus on data retrieval,
list manipulation, and user interaction.

## Task 1: Student Marks Lookup Using Dictionary

### Description
This task creates a dictionary where student names are stored as keys and their
corresponding marks are stored as values. The program asks the user to enter a
student’s name and then displays the student’s marks.

If the entered student name does not exist in the dictionary, an appropriate
message is displayed.

### Concepts Used
- Dictionary data structure
- Key–value lookup
- User input
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)

### Sample Output
- If student exists:
Alice's marks: 85

- If student does not exist:
Student not found.

## Task 2: List Slicing and Reversal

### Description
This task creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10. It then extracts the first five
elements from the list, reverses the extracted elements, and prints both the
original extracted list and the reversed list.

### Concepts Used
- Lists
- List slicing
- List reversal
- Printing formatted output

### Sample Output

Extracted elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
